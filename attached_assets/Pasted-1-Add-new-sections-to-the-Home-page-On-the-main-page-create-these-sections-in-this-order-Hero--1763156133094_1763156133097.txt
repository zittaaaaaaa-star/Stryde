1. Add new sections to the Home page

On the main page, create these sections in this order:

Hero (keep as is, just update logo & colors as described below).

Elevator Pitch Video section (NEW – goes above the product section).

Product section (keep my existing product cards / content).

About Us section (NEW).

Experience section (NEW).

Meet the Team section (NEW).

Each of these should be clearly separated and full-width with good padding on desktop and mobile.

2. Elevator Pitch Video section (above products)

Create a section above the product section with:

A title: “Elevator Pitch”

A subtitle line:

“Watch our quick overview and see how EVL powers every step.”

A centered video player (use my existing video file if there is one, or a placeholder <video>/iframe I can swap later).

A small lightning bolt icon near the title (for example using Zap from lucide-react) or an emoji ⚡.

Make sure this section has a visually distinct background (e.g., slightly darker or lighter than the main background).

3. About Us section

Add a new section titled “About Us” with:

Heading text: “About Us ⚡” (include the lightning bolt).

1–2 short paragraphs describing the brand (you can use placeholder text that I can edit).

Example placeholder copy:

EVL is a forward-thinking brand focused on turning everyday movement into real impact. We blend clean design, smart tech, and bold energy to create experiences people can feel under their feet.

Use a simple two-column layout on desktop (text on one side, optional image/graphic on the other) and stack them on mobile.

4. Experience section

Add a new section titled “Experience” with:

Heading: “Experience EVL”

Subheading:

“See what it feels like when every stride lights up the floor.”

3 feature cards or columns, for example:

Step – People walk naturally across the tiles.

Energy – Each step triggers light and energy.

Insight – Every stride generates data and engagement.

Add a small lightning bolt icon in each card or next to the section title.

5. Meet the Team section

Add a new section titled “Meet the Team” with:

A short intro line:

“The minds behind EVL.”

A responsive grid of team member cards (you can add 2–4 placeholder members), each card with:

Name

Role

Short 1–2 sentence bio

Example placeholder card:

Eric Zheng – Founder & Experience Designer

Eric focuses on turning ideas into interactive experiences, blending tech, design, and real-world impact.

Use a card style that matches the new site colors and includes a small lightning bolt accent (icon or emoji) somewhere subtle.

6. Lightning bolt usage

Throughout the page:

Use a lightning bolt icon (for example Zap from lucide-react) or the emoji ⚡:

Next to some section titles (Elevator Pitch, About Us, Experience, CTAs).

Optionally in CTA buttons like: Get Started ⚡ or Learn More ⚡.

Keep it consistent and not overused.

7. Update the logo

Update the site’s logo to use the attached logo image that I added to the project (replace the current logo image).

Use this new logo in the navbar on every page.

Make the logo clickable to go back to the Home page.

Ensure it looks sharp on both desktop and mobile (reasonable width/height, no distortion).

If the project already has a Logo component, update that to use the new image file. Otherwise, create one.

8. Update the color palette to match the logo

Extract the main colors from the attached logo image and:

Update the site’s primary background, accent, and button colors to match the logo’s palette.

Make sure:

Text is accessible and high contrast.

Buttons and links use the accent color(s) from the logo.

Hover states stay within that palette.

If Tailwind is used with a config file, update the theme colors (e.g., primary, secondary, accent) to match the logo’s colors and refactor the components to use those classes where appropriate.

9. General styling & responsiveness

Keep everything fully responsive for mobile and desktop.

Maintain consistent spacing (padding, margins) between the new sections and the existing ones.

Make sure the new sections visually fit with the rest of the site after the color palette update.
